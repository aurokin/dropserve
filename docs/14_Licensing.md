# Licensing Notes

This project intends to be source-available/open for self-hosting.

## Important note

"Open source" as commonly defined by the Open Source Definition does not allow restricting commercial use.

If you want "not for commercial use", consider describing the project as "source available" and using an appropriate license that restricts commercial usage.

## Options

1. OSI open-source license (allows commercial use)
   - MIT / Apache-2.0 / GPLv3 / AGPLv3

2. Source-available non-commercial
   - A license with a non-commercial restriction (not OSI open source)

3. Dual license
   - Open-source license for community use, and a separate commercial license

## Action item

Decide licensing strategy before the first public release and reflect it in:
- repository LICENSE file
- README
- any contribution guidelines
