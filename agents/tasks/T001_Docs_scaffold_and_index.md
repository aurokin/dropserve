# Task: T001 - Docs scaffold and index

## Goal

Create the documentation structure and ensure the index links to all docs.

## Required reading (MUST read before starting)

- `docs/README.md`
- `agents/00_Read_First.md`
- `agents/04_Task_Template.md`

## Deliverables

- All files under `docs/` exist and are linked from `docs/README.md`.
- All agent guidance files exist under `agents/`.

## Steps

1. Create any missing files in `docs/` and `agents/` per `docs/README.md`.
2. Update `docs/README.md` to link to all docs.
3. Add short placeholders if any doc is not yet written.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Index has working links to all doc files.
- [ ] Agents folder contains read-first + workflow + DoD + template.

## Tests to run

- No code tests; markdown validation optional.

## Notes

- None.
