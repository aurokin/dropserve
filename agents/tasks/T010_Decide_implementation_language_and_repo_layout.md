# Task: T010 - Decide implementation language and repo layout

## Goal

Pick a concrete implementation stack (default Go) and define the repository structure.

## Required reading (MUST read before starting)

- `docs/03_Architecture.md`
- `docs/01_Product_Brief.md`
- `agents/02_Coding_Standards.md`

## Deliverables

- A `repo/` layout document or README section describing server, CLI, and web UI directories.
- A build/run plan for local development.

## Steps

1. Choose Go for server+CLI unless project lead specifies otherwise.
2. Define where web assets live and how they are served (embedded or static dir).
3. Document local run commands.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Repo layout is unambiguous.
- [ ] Local run steps do not mention NGINX.

## Tests to run

- N/A (documentation task).

## Notes

- None.
