# Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria in the task file are satisfied.
2. Any new behavior is reflected in the relevant docs in `docs/`.
3. Tests are added or updated (unit/integration as appropriate).
4. No changes violate:
   - `docs/portal-lifecycle.md`
   - `docs/api.md`
   - `docs/file-safety.md`
5. `/api/control/*` remains unexposed via Caddy.
