# Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria in the task file are satisfied.
2. Any new behavior is reflected in the relevant docs in `docs/`.
3. Tests are added or updated (unit/integration as appropriate).
4. No changes violate:
   - `docs/04_Portal_Spec.md`
   - `docs/06_File_IO_and_Cleanup.md`
   - `docs/07_Path_Safety.md`
5. The Control API remains unexposed via Caddy.
